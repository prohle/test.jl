Define the ones we actually need.\n@tags div p em strong ul li\n\ndiv(\n    p(\"This \", em(\"is\"), \" a \", strong(\"paragraph.\"),\n    p(\"And this is \", strong(\"another\"), \" one\"),\n    ul(\n        li(\"and\"),\n        li(\"an\"),\n        li(\"unordered\"),\n        li(\"list\")\n    )\n)\n\nNotes\n\nAll the arguments passed to a node are flattened into a single vector rather than preserving any nested structure. This means that passing two vectors of nodes to a div will result in a div node with a single vector of children (the concatenation of the two vectors) rather than two vector children. The only arguments that are not flattened are nested nodes.\n\nString arguments are automatically converted into text nodes. Text nodes do not have any children or attributes and when displayed the string is escaped using escapehtml.\n\nAttributes\n\nAs well as plain nodes shown in the previous example, nodes can have attributes added to them using the following syntax.\n\ndiv[\".my-class\"](\n    img[:src => \"foo.jpg\"],\n    input[\"#my-id\", :disabled]\n)\n\nIn the above example we add a class = \"my-class\" attribute to the div node, a src = \"foo.jpg\" to the img, and id = \"my-id\" disabled attributes to the input node.\n\nThe following syntax is supported within [...]:\n\ntag[\"#id\"]\ntag[\".class\"]\ntag[\".class#id\"]\ntag[:disabled]\ntag[:src => \"foo.jpg\"]\n# ... or any combination of the above arguments.\n\nInternal Representation\n\nThe @tags macro defines named Tag objects as follows\n\n@tags div p em strong\n\nexpands to\n\nconst div, p, em, strong = Tag(:div), Tag(:p), Tag(:em), Tag(:strong)\n\nThese Tag objects are lightweight representations of empty HTML elements without any attributes and cannot be used to represent a complete document. To create an actual tree of HTML elements that can be rendered we need to add some attributes and/or child elements using getindex or call syntax. Applying either to a Tag object will construct a new Node object.\n\ntag(...)      # No attributes.\ntag[...]      # No children.\ntag[...](...) # Has both attributes and children.\n\nAll three of the above syntaxes return a new Node object. Printing of Node objects is defined using the standard Julia display functions, so only needs a call to print to print out a valid HTML document with all nessesary text escaped.\n\n\n\n\n\n","category":"module"},{"location":"lib/internals/dom/#Documenter.Utilities.DOM.HTMLDocument","page":"DOM","title":"Documenter.Utilities.DOM.HTMLDocument","text":"A HTML node that wraps around the root node of the document and adds a DOCTYPE to it.\n\n\n\n\n\n","category":"type"},{"location":"lib/internals/dom/#Documenter.Utilities.DOM.Node","page":"DOM","title":"Documenter.Utilities.DOM.Node","text":"Represents an element within an HTML document including any textual content, children Nodes, and attributes.\n\nThis type should not be constructed directly, but instead via (...) and [...] applied to a Tag or another Node object.\n\n\n\n\n\n","category":"type"},{"location":"lib/internals/dom/#Documenter.Utilities.DOM.Tag","page":"DOM","title":"Documenter.Utilities.DOM.Tag","text":"Represents a empty and attribute-less HTML element.\n\nUse @tags to define instances of this type rather than manually creating them via Tag(:tagname).\n\n\n\n\n\n","category":"type"},{"location":"lib/internals/dom/#Documenter.Utilities.DOM.escapehtml-Tuple{AbstractString}","page":"DOM","title":"Documenter.Utilities.DOM.escapehtml","text":"Escape characters in the provided string.

In most cases makedocs should be run from a make.jl file:\n\nusing Documenter\nmakedocs(\n    # keywords...\n)\n\nwhich is then run from the command line with:\n\n$ julia make.jl\n\nThe folder structure that makedocs expects looks like:\n\ndocs/\n    build/\n    src/\n    make.jl\n\nKeywords\n\nroot is the directory from which makedocs should run. When run from a make.jl file this keyword does not need to be set. It is, for the most part, needed when repeatedly running makedocs from the Julia REPL like so:\n\njulia> makedocs(root = joinpath(dirname(pathof(MyModule)), \"..\", \"docs\"))\n\nsource is the directory, relative to root, where the markdown source files are read from. By convention this folder is called src. Note that any non-markdown files stored in source are copied over to the build directory when makedocs is run.\n\nbuild is the directory, relative to root, into which generated files and folders are written when makedocs is run. The name of the build directory is, by convention, called build, though, like with source, users are free to change this to anything else to better suit their project needs.\n\nclean tells makedocs whether to remove all the content from the build folder prior to generating new content from source. By default this is set to true.\n\ndoctest instructs makedocs on whether to try to test Julia code blocks that are encountered in the generated document. By default this keyword is set to true. Doctesting should only ever be disabled when initially setting up a newly developed package where the developer is just trying to get their package and documentation structure correct. After that, it's encouraged to always make sure that documentation examples are runnable and produce the expected results. See the Doctests manual section for details about running doctests.\n\nSetting doctest to :only allows for doctesting without a full build. In this mode, most build stages are skipped and the strict keyword is ignore (a doctesting error will always make makedocs throw an error).\n\nmodules specifies a vector of modules that should be documented in source. If any inline docstrings from those modules are seen to be missing from the generated content then a warning will be printed during execution of makedocs. By default no modules are passed to modules and so no warnings will appear. This setting can be used as an indicator of the \"coverage\" of the generated documentation. For example Documenter's make.jl file contains:\n\nmakedocs(\n    modules = [Documenter],\n    # ...\n)\n\nand so any docstring from the module Documenter that is not spliced into the generated documentation in build will raise a warning.\n\nrepo specifies a template for the \"link to source\" feature. If you are using GitHub, this is automatically generated from the remote. If you are using a different host, you can use this option to tell Documenter how URLs should be generated. The following placeholders will be replaced with the respective value of the generated link:\n\n{commit} Git branch or tag name, or commit hash\n{path} Path to the file in the repository\n{line} Line (or range of lines) in the source file\n\nBitBucket, GitLab and Azure DevOps are supported along with GitHub, for example:\n\nmakedocs(repo = \"https://gitlab.com/user/project/blob/{commit}{path}#{line}\") # GitLab\nmakedocs(repo = \"https://dev.azure.com/org/project/_git/repo?path={path}&version={commit}{line}&lineStartColumn=1&lineEndColumn=1\") # Azure DevOps\nmakedocs(repo = \"https://bitbucket.org/user/project/src/{commit}/{path}#lines-{line}\") # BitBucket\n\nhighlightsig enables or disables automatic syntax highlighting of leading, unlabeled code blocks in docstrings (as Julia code). For example, if your docstring begins with an indented code block containing the function signature, then that block would be highlighted as if it were a labeled Julia code block. No other code blocks are affected. This feature is enabled by default.\n\nsitename is displayed in the title bar and/or the navigation menu when applicable.\n\nexpandfirst allows some of the pages to be expanded (i.e. at-blocks evaluated etc.) before the others. Documenter normally evaluates the files in the alphabetic order of their file paths relative to src, but expandfirst allows some pages to be prioritized.\n\nFor example, if you have foo.md and bar.md, bar.md would normally be evaluated before foo.md. But with expandfirst = [\"foo.md\"], you can force foo.md to be evaluated first.\n\nEvaluation order among the expandfirst pages is according to the order they appear in the argument.\n\nExperimental keywords\n\nIn addition to standard arguments there is a set of non-finalized experimental keyword arguments. The behaviour of these may change or they may be removed without deprecation when a minor version changes (i.e. except in patch releases).\n\ncheckdocs instructs makedocs to check whether all names within the modules defined in the modules keyword that have a docstring attached have the docstring also listed in the manual (e.g. there's a @docs block with that docstring). Possible values are :all (check all names; the default), :exports (check only exported names) and :none (no checks are performed). If strict is also enabled then the build will fail if any missing docstrings are encountered.\n\nlinkcheck – if set to true makedocs uses curl to check the status codes of external-pointing links, to make sure that they are up-to-date. The links and their status codes are printed to the standard output. If strict is also enabled then the build will fail if there are any broken (400+ status code) links. Default: false.\n\nlinkcheck_ignore allows certain URLs to be ignored in linkcheck. The values should be a list of strings (which get matched exactly) or Regex objects. By default nothing is ignored.\n\nlinkcheck_timeout configures how long curl waits (in seconds) for a link request to return a response before giving up. The default is 10 seconds.\n\nstrict – makedocs fails the build right before rendering if it encountered any errors with the document in the previous build phases.\n\nworkdir determines the working directory where @example and @repl code blocks are executed. It can be either a path or the special value :build (default).\n\nIf the workdir is set to a path, the working directory is reset to that path for each code block being evaluated. Relative paths are taken to be relative to root, but using absolute paths is recommended (e.g. workdir = joinpath(@__DIR__, \"..\") for executing in the package root for the usual docs/make.jl setup).\n\nWith the default :build option, the working directory is set to a subdirectory of build, determined from the source file path. E.g. for src/foo.md it is set to build/, for src/foo/bar.md it is set to build/foo etc.\n\nNote that workdir does not affect doctests.\n\nOutput formats\n\nformat allows the output format to be specified. The default format is Documenter.HTML which creates a set of HTML files, but Documenter also provides PDF output via the Documenter.LaTeX writer.\n\nOther formats can be enabled by using other addon-packages. For example, the DocumenterMarkdown package provides the original Markdown -> Markdown output. See the Other Output Formats for more information.\n\nSee Also\n\nA guide detailing how to document a package using Documenter's makedocs is provided in the setup guide in the manual.\n\n\n\n\n\n","category":"function"},{"location":"lib/public/#Documenter.hide","page":"Public","title":"Documenter.hide","text":"hide(page)\n\n\nAllows a page to be hidden in the navigation menu.

Do not specify any protocol - \"https://\" or \"git@\" should not be present. This keyword must be set and will throw an error when left undefined. For example this package uses the following repo value:\n\nrepo = \"github.com/JuliaDocs/Documenter.jl.git\"\n\nOptional keyword arguments\n\ndeploy_config determines configuration for the deployment. If this is not specified Documenter will try to autodetect from the currently running environment. See the manual section about Deployment systems.\n\nroot has the same purpose as the root keyword for makedocs.\n\ntarget is the directory, relative to root, where generated content that should be deployed to gh-pages is written to. It should generally be the same as makedocs's build and defaults to \"build\".\n\nbranch is the branch where the generated documentation is pushed. If the branch does not exist, a new orphaned branch is created automatically. It defaults to \"gh-pages\".\n\ndeps is the function used to install any additional dependencies needed to build the documentation. By default nothing is installed.\n\nIt can be used e.g. for a Markdown build. The following example installed the pygments and mkdocs Python packages using the Deps.pip function:\n\ndeps = Deps.pip(\"pygments\", \"mkdocs\")\n\nmake is the function used to specify an additional build phase. By default, nothing gets executed.\n\ndevbranch is the branch that \"tracks\" the in-development version of the generated documentation. By default this value is set to \"master\".\n\ndevurl the folder that in-development version of the docs will be deployed. Defaults to \"dev\".\n\nforcepush a boolean that specifies the behavior of the git-deployment. The default (forcepush = false) is to push a new commit, but when forcepush = true the changes will be combined with the previous commit and force pushed, erasing the Git history on the deployment branch.\n\nversions determines content and order of the resulting version selector in the generated html. The following entries are valid in the versions vector:\n\n\"v#\": includes links to the latest documentation for each major release cycle (i.e. v2.0, v1.1).\n\"v#.#\": includes links to the latest documentation for each minor release cycle (i.e. v2.0, v1.1, v1.0, v0.1).\n\"v#.#.#\": includes links to all released versions.\n\"v^\": includes a link to the docs for the maximum version (i.e. a link vX.Y pointing to vX.Y.Z for highest X, Y, Z, respectively).\nA pair, e.g. \"first\" => \"second\", which will put \"first\" in the selector, and generate a url from which \"second\" can be accessed. The second argument can be \"v^\", to point to the maximum version docs (as in e.g. \"stable\" => \"v^\").\n\npush_preview a boolean that specifies if preview documentation should be deployed from pull requests or not. If your published documentation is hosted at \"https://USER.github.io/PACKAGE.jl/stable, by default the preview will be hosted at \"https://USER.github.io/PACKAGE.jl/previews/PR##\". This feature works for pull requests with head branch in the same repository, i.e. not from forks.\n\nbranch_previews is the branch to which pull request previews are deployed.
